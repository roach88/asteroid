# Asteroids Roguelike Product Context

## Why This Project Exists

The Asteroids Roguelike project aims to create a modern twist on the classic arcade game "Asteroids" by incorporating roguelike elements. This solo development project serves as:

- A showcase of game design and development skills
- A portfolio piece demonstrating the ability to blend retro gameplay with modern mechanics
- A potentially publishable game for platforms like GitHub or other distribution channels

## Problems It Solves

- Limited replayability in traditional arcade games
- Lack of progression in the original Asteroids game
- Predictable enemy patterns that become repetitive

## How It Should Work

The game follows this core loop:

1. Player navigates a spaceship through waves of asteroids
2. After clearing a wave, player selects one of three randomly offered perks
3. Subsequent waves increase in difficulty and introduce new enemy types
4. Player continues until death, aiming to reach higher waves than previous attempts

The roguelike elements create unique gameplay experiences each session through:

- Random perk offerings that allow different build strategies
- Varied enemy compositions and elite enemies appearing at different times
- Progressive difficulty scaling that challenges players to adapt

## User Experience Goals

The game aims to deliver these key experiences:

1. **Power Progression**: Players should feel a growing sense of power through accumulated perks while facing escalating challenges.

2. **Meaningful Choice**: Each perk selection should present interesting strategic options that impact gameplay.

3. **Surprise and Variety**: Random elements like elite enemy spawns and perk offerings should create variety between play sessions.

4. **Balanced Pacing**: The game should provide tension during waves and brief respite between waves for strategic decisions.

5. **Session-Based Play**: Complete gameplay sessions target 5-10 minutes, allowing for quick but satisfying play experiences.

The narrative framing of a pilot trapped in a cursed sector of space adds context to the roguelike mechanics, with dimensional rifts explaining the waves of increasingly dangerous asteroids.
