# Asteroids Roguelike Progress

## Current Status

The project has moved from the planning phase to active implementation. The core game structure has been established with significant progress on the first milestone: **Improve Wave Flow & Progression**.

## What Works

- Initial project planning and feature design document completed
- Core pygame project structure implemented:
  - Main game loop with state management
  - Entity system (Player, Asteroids, Shots)
  - Wave management and transitions
  - UI system for game state transitions
- First milestone features implemented:
  - Wave interlude screen with countdown timer
  - Wave composition scaling (increasing difficulty)
  - Basic elite enemy structure (with three types defined)
  - Perk selection UI between waves
- Second milestone features partially implemented:
  - Perk system foundation and manager
  - Perk selection UI
- Third milestone (Elite Enemies) significantly advanced:
  - Refactored elite asteroid design using proper inheritance hierarchy
  - Implemented specialized elite classes with unique behaviors
  - Added attack angle-based damage system
  - Enhanced visual and gameplay mechanics for elite asteroids

## What's Left to Build

Based on the project brief's milestone sequencing:

1. **Improve Wave Flow & Progression**

   - [x] Wave interlude screen implementation
   - [x] Wave timer/countdown system
   - [x] Wave composition scaling mechanism
   - [ ] Health regeneration systems
   - [ ] Boss wave implementation (for every 5th wave)

2. **Add Upgrade & Perk System**

   - [x] Create Perk class structure
   - [x] Implement perk manager
   - [x] Design UI for perk selection
   - [ ] Complete implementation of passive perks (movement speed, HP, piercing bullets)
   - [ ] Complete implementation of active perks (EMP blast, shield recharge, teleport)

3. **Design + Implement Elite Enemies**
   - [x] Extend Asteroid class for elite variants
   - [x] Implement class inheritance structure for elite types
   - [x] Create Exploder elite type with specialized behavior
   - [x] Create Shielded elite type with directional damage reduction
   - [x] Create Swarm Leader elite type with unpredictable movement
   - [x] Implement factory pattern for elite asteroid creation
   - [x] Add angle-based collision detection for tactical gameplay
   - [ ] Further enhance distinct visuals for elite enemies
   - [ ] Balance elite enemy spawn rates and behaviors

## Implementation Priorities

Current priorities:

1. Complete and refine the Wave Flow & Progression features
2. Finalize the perk system implementation
3. Further polish elite enemy behaviors and visuals

## Known Issues

Now that implementation has begun, some challenges have emerged:

- Need to balance the difficulty progression across waves
- Refining perk effects to ensure they feel impactful without being overpowered
- Optimizing collision detection for numerous entities
- Fine-tuning elite enemy behaviors for better gameplay variety

## Next Steps

1. Complete the remaining Wave Flow features (health regeneration, boss waves)
2. Finalize perk implementation with full effects
3. Further refine elite enemy visuals and behaviors
4. Add more polish and balance to existing features

## Success Metrics Status

Success metrics defined in the project brief can now start being tracked:

- Session duration: Initial implementation seems to be on track for the 5-10 minute target
- Perk selection: Early testing shows perks are being selected, but balance needs refinement
- Wave progression: Need to gather more data on average wave reached
- Elite enemy engagement: Elite enemies have been significantly enhanced with better visuals and behaviors
