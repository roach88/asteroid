# Asteroids Roguelike Progress

## Current Status

The project is in the planning/design phase with a feature design document (project brief) created. Implementation has likely not begun or is in very early stages.

## What Works

- Initial project planning and feature design document completed
- Core gameplay concepts defined:
  - Roguelike progression system
  - Elite enemy types
  - Wave progression structure

## What's Left to Build

Based on the project brief's milestone sequencing:

1. **Improve Wave Flow & Progression**

   - [ ] Wave interlude screen implementation
   - [ ] Wave timer/countdown system
   - [ ] Wave composition scaling mechanism
   - [ ] Health regeneration systems
   - [ ] Boss wave implementation (for every 5th wave)

2. **Add Upgrade & Perk System**

   - [ ] Create Perk class structure
   - [ ] Implement perk manager
   - [ ] Design UI for perk selection
   - [ ] Implement passive perks (movement speed, HP, piercing bullets)
   - [ ] Implement active perks (EMP blast, shield recharge, teleport)

3. **Design + Implement Elite Enemies**
   - [ ] Extend Asteroid class for elite variants
   - [ ] Implement Exploder enemy type
   - [ ] Implement Shielded enemy type
   - [ ] Implement Swarm Leader enemy type
   - [ ] Design distinct visuals for elite enemies
   - [ ] Balance elite enemy spawn rates

## Implementation Priorities

The milestone sequencing suggests this priority order:

1. First focus on wave progression and flow
2. Then develop the perk system
3. Finally add elite enemy variations

## Known Issues

As the project appears to be in the planning phase, no implementation issues have been encountered yet. Potential challenges to anticipate:

- Balancing difficulty progression across waves
- Creating visually distinct elite enemies
- Implementing an intuitive interlude UI for perk selection
- Ensuring perks feel meaningful and balanced

## Next Steps

1. Begin implementation of the Wave Flow & Progression enhancements
2. Create basic framework for tracking game state between waves
3. Implement wave interlude screen with timing controls
4. Test wave progression mechanics before moving to perk system development

## Success Metrics Status

Success metrics defined in the project brief are not yet being tracked as implementation has not begun. Once implemented, we'll monitor:

- Session duration (target 5â€“10 mins average)
- Perk selection rate
- Average wave reached before death
- Elite enemy engagement
