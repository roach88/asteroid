# Asteroids Roguelike Active Context

## Current Work Focus

The project has progressed from the initial planning phase into active implementation. The core game structure has been established and significant progress has been made on the first milestone: **Improve Wave Flow & Progression**.

The immediate focus is on completing the remaining features of the first milestone and polishing the currently implemented features, particularly the perk system and elite enemy behaviors.

## Recent Changes

- Implemented core game components:

  - Main game loop with state management system (playing, wave transition, perk selection, game over)
  - Entity system including Player, Asteroids, Shots
  - Wave management with difficulty scaling
  - UI system for game transitions and perk selection

- Completed key features of the first milestone:

  - Wave interlude screen with countdown timer
  - Wave composition scaling with increasing difficulty per wave
  - Transition between gameplay and perk selection

- Made significant progress on the perk system:

  - Implemented PerkManager class
  - Created UI for perk selection between waves
  - Added player method to apply perks

- Implemented elite enemy foundation:
  - Created EliteAsteroid class extending from base Asteroid
  - Implemented three elite types (Exploder, Shielded, Swarm Leader)
  - Added logic for elite spawning based on wave number

## Next Steps

Following the progress already made:

1. Complete remaining first milestone features:

   - Add health regeneration system
   - Implement boss waves (every 5th wave)

2. Finalize perk system implementation:

   - Complete effects for all passive perks
   - Implement active perk mechanics
   - Balance perk impacts for meaningful choices

3. Polish elite enemy implementation:

   - Enhance visual distinction for elite enemies
   - Fine-tune elite behaviors for better gameplay
   - Balance elite spawn rates across waves

4. Once above items are complete, focus on game polish:
   - Add more visual feedback for player actions
   - Improve UI elements for better readability
   - Add sound effects and potentially background music

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Architecture Decisions

- The game uses a state-based architecture with distinct states for gameplay, wave transitions, perk selection, and game over
- Entity management is handled through pygame sprite groups for efficient updates and collision detection
- Wave management is implemented with scaling difficulty based on wave number
- Elite enemies extend the base asteroid class with specialized behaviors

### Design Considerations

- Current visuals for elite enemies need enhancement to make them more distinctive
- Perk effects need to be balanced to ensure they're impactful without being overpowered
- Wave difficulty scaling appears to work but may need fine-tuning for better player progression

### Technical Considerations

- Collision detection is working but may need optimization as entity count increases
- Perk implementation currently focuses on passive effects; active perks will require additional input handling
- Elite enemy behaviors add complexity to asteroid movement patterns

### Current Questions

- What visual effects would best communicate elite enemy status?
- How should active perks be triggered and what cooldown mechanisms should be implemented?
- What additional balancing is needed for wave difficulty progression?
- Should boss waves have unique visuals or behaviors beyond regular elites?

## Implementation Approach

The current development approach follows the planned iterative process:

1. Core gameplay loop is now functional with wave management
2. Perk system foundation is in place but needs completion
3. Elite enemies are implemented but need visual and behavioral polish
4. Next focus will be on completing health regeneration and boss waves
5. Final polish will focus on visual feedback and balancing

This approach has allowed for testing the core mechanics while gradually layering in the roguelike elements.
