# Asteroids Roguelike Technical Context

## Technologies Used

Based on the project brief, the following technologies are likely being used:

### Core Technologies

- **Python**: Primary programming language
- **Pygame**: Game development library for Python, handling rendering, input, and basic game mechanics

### Supporting Technologies

- **Git/GitHub**: Version control and potential publishing platform
- **Pip**: Package management for Python dependencies

## Development Setup

### Environment Requirements

- Python 3.x installation
- Pygame library installed via pip
- Code editor/IDE with Python support

### Project Structure

A typical pygame project structure might include:

```mermaid

│   ├── images/
│   ├── sounds/
│   └── fonts/

└── README.md
```

## Technical Constraints

### Performance Considerations

- **Frame Rate**: Target 60 FPS for smooth gameplay
- **Entity Count**: Manage the number of active entities to avoid performance issues
- **Collision Detection**: Optimize collision detection for large numbers of asteroids and projectiles

### Cross-Platform Compatibility

- Pygame supports Windows, macOS, and Linux
- UI scaling should adapt to different screen resolutions

### Input Handling

- Support for keyboard controls
- Potentially support for gamepad input

## Dependencies

### Required Libraries

- **Pygame**: Primary game development framework
  - Handles rendering, input, sound, and game loop
  - Provides basic collision detection

### Potential Additional Libraries

- **NumPy**: May be useful for more complex math operations (vector calculations, etc.)
- **Pickle/JSON**: For saving game stats or configurations
- **Random**: For randomization of perks, asteroid spawning, etc.

## Build and Distribution

### Development Cycle

1. Local development and testing
2. Version control via Git
3. Potential packaging as standalone executable

### Distribution Options

- GitHub repository with source code
- Potentially packaged as executable using tools like PyInstaller or cx_Freeze
- Web deployment possible using Pygbag (Pygame for WebAssembly)

## Technical Debt Considerations

- Ensure proper separation of game logic and rendering for maintainability
- Plan for extensibility in the perk system to easily add new perks
- Design the wave system to scale with difficulty in a balanced way
