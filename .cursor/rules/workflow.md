# ðŸ“‹ Asteroids Roguelike Workflow

## Development Workflow

- Focus on implementing and testing one milestone at a time
- Test gameplay feel regularly during development
- Track progress against defined success metrics
- Document design decisions for future reference

## Implementation Sequence

Follow this implementation sequence based on the project milestones:

1. **Improve Wave Flow & Progression**

   - Start with core game mechanics
   - Implement wave management structure
   - Add interlude screens
   - Implement progressive difficulty scaling

2. **Add Upgrade & Perk System**

   - Create perk class structure
   - Implement selection UI
   - Add passive perk effects
   - Add active perk abilities

3. **Design + Implement Elite Enemies**
   - Extend asteroid class
   - Add specialized behaviors
   - Create distinct visuals
   - Balance spawn rates

## Testing Focus

- Test core gameplay loop frequently to ensure it remains fun
- Evaluate perk balance by playing through multiple waves
- Test performance with increasing numbers of entities
- Verify that difficulty scaling feels challenging but fair

## Success Metrics Tracking

Monitor these metrics during development:

- Session duration (target 5â€“10 mins average)
- Perk selection rate (ensure all perks are viable choices)
- Average wave reached before death (balance indicator)
- Elite enemy encounter rate and effectiveness

## Memory Bank Maintenance

- Update `progress.md` after completing significant features
- Keep `activeContext.md` current with the latest work focus
- Document any major design decisions in `systemPatterns.md`
- Track implementation challenges and solutions

## Memory Bank Update Process

When updating the memory bank:

1. Review all files to ensure consistency
2. Document current state accurately
3. Update next steps based on recent progress
4. Capture any new technical insights or challenges

## When to Update Memory Bank

- After completing a significant feature or milestone
- When changing focus to a new area of development
- Before taking a break from the project
- After discovering important patterns or solutions
